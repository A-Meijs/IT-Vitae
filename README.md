These folders are different programs
Calc is some failed calculator. Abandoned after I couldn't find/implement a way to store equations.
Euler20 expands somewhat on Project Euler problem 20, in that it works for arbitrary numbers rather than just 100
Flags is an attempt at a program meant to display flags of the world. This didn't get very far either, but I might have been able to actually make this one. Abandoned to focus on other things.
